# Does the operator have any relation to polymorphism?
# Polymorphism = “many forms.” In C++ it mainly means:
# - Compile-time polymorphism (static) → function overloading and operator overloading.

# -> Run-time polymorphism (dynamic) → virtual functions and overriding in class hierarchies.
# oject has virtual pointer to virtual tbale // todo
# each object has own virtual pointer

# Polymorphsim ?
# - Inclusion ?
# - Coersion ?
# - Parametric ?
# - Ad-hoc ?
# What is ad-hoc polymorphsim when the functions having same to act differently for different types
# What is inclusion polymorphsim 
# if the class has the parametrized constructor does the  compiler generate the zero-argument constructor

# 1.default constructor
# 2. Parameterized Constructor 
# 3.When the parmeterized construtor is defined does the compiler generate the defualt constructor ?
# Copy Elision
# Copy Constructor vs Assignment Operator in C++
